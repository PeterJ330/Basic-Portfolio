                    Make a "sticky footer." You will notice the dark grey footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most monitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:
                </p>
                  <br>
                <p>
                Try to code the footer in a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. A sticky footer tutorial can be found here.
